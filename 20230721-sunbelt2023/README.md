Agent-based models [ABMs] have become a prominent tool in epidemiological studies, including forecasting and simulating health interventions. A key component of ABM is the underlying network structure. Yet, most of the time (despite much science indicating the importance of using realistic networks,) we opt for using simple random graph models that massively simplify real-life social networks. The structure of social networks can significantly affect the prevalence and transmissibility of diseases. Preliminary results indicate that, for example, the reproductive number--the count of secondary infections--may not correctly reflect how fast a virus spreads. Preliminary results for scale-free and small-world networks show that although the reproductive number tends to approach one, a virus may still diffuse rapidly across the network, indicating that (i) the underlying network model used in the system may not be appropriate and (ii) that the reproductive number may still fail to capture vital information about an outbreak. Here we present a large ABM simulation study to understand how epidemiological indicators vary as a function of network structure. Using real-world networks collected from the Veterans Administration health system (the United States VA,) we identify the structural features that characterize simulated outbreaks and compare those with what we would obtain under similar conditions with a prescribed set of random graphs models, including scale-free and small-world networks. We finalize by characterizing the distribution of common epidemiological indicators in ABMs as a function of key traits of the underlying social network structure supporting the model. Our research helps us understand how networks affect ABMs, which is paramount for researchers and policymakers.
