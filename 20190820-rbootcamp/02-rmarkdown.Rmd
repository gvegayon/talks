```{r setup-chunk, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
library(knitr)

opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

# Rmarkdown files

*   These are plain-text (not binary) files
    
    ```{r hello-rmd, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
    cat(readLines("hello-world.Rmd"), sep="\n")
    ```

# Main components of a Rmd file

*   The header: Information about the document in [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML){target="_blank"} format
    
    ```{r hello-rmd-yaml, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
    cat(readLines("hello-world.Rmd")[1:6], sep="\n")
    ```

*   R code chunks (with options)
    
    ```{r hello-rmd-chunk1, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
    cat(readLines("hello-world.Rmd")[16:18], sep="\n")
    ```

*   R code chunks (without options)

    ```{r hello-rmd-chunk2, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
    cat(readLines("hello-world.Rmd")[24:26], sep="\n")
    ```

---

*   Some other options include:

    -   `cache`: Logical, when `TRUE` saves the result of the code chunk so it
        doesn't need to compute it every time (handy for time-consuming code!)
        
    -   `messages`: Logical, when `FALSE` it suppress whatever message the R
        code in the chunk generates.
        
    -   `fig.cap`: Character vector. Specifies the title of plots generated
        whitin the chunk.

# How it works

<div align="center">
<img src="../../fig/rmarkdownflow.png" style="width:800px;">

Source: RStudio website https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html
</div>

*   The function `render` passes the Rmd file to [**knitr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr)

*   knitr executes the R code (or whatever code is there), and creates a `md` file
    (markdown, not Rmarkdown)
    
*   Then the `md` file is passed to [**pandoc**](http://pandoc.org/),
    which ultimately compiles the
    document in the desired format as specified in the `output` option
    of the header.

# Questions

Taking a look at the Rmarkdown cheatsheet, answer the following questions:

1.  How can you write bold faced text? What about italics?

2.  Include a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level headers in a document?

3.  Include an R code **chunk** without it being evaluated?

4.  Tell pandoc to compile a MS Word document?

5.  Include a figure from a `png` file that you have in the same folder as your
    markdown document?
    
6.  Include a mathematical equation?

# Rmarkdown supports other formats

*   The following code chunk requires having the [**reticulate**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate) R package (R interface to Python)


    ```{r pypy, comment="", echo=FALSE}
    cat("```{python some-py-code}\nprint \"Hello World\"\nimport this\n```\n")
    ```
        
    
    ```{python some-py-code, echo=FALSE}
    print "Hello World"
    import this
    ```


# Tables with Rmarkdown

*   Suppose that we want to include the following data as a table part of our
    document
    
    ```{r stats-by-year}
    # Loading the package
    library(gapminder)
    
    # Calculating stats at the year level
    stats_by_year <- gapminder %>%
      group_by(year) %>%
      summarise(
        `Life Expectancy` = mean(lifeExp),
        `Population`      = mean(pop),
        `GDP pp`          = mean(gdpPercap)
      ) %>%
      arrange(year)
    
    stats_by_year
    ```
    
    There are at least 2 ways of doing it

# Tabulation with `knitr::kable`

*   The knitr package provides the function `kable` to print tables.

*   It has the nice feature that you don't need to be explicit about the format,
    i.e. it will automatically guess what type of document you are working with.

    ```{r kable}
    knitr::kable(
        stats_by_year,
        caption = "Year stats from the gapminder data",
        format.args = list(big.mark=",")
        )
    ```

*   Checkout [**kableExtra**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kableExtra) which
    provides extensions to the `kable` function.

# Tabulation with `pander::pandoc.table`

*   Another (very cool) R package is [**pander**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pander)

*   It provides helper functions to work with pandoc's markdown format

*   This means that you don't need to think about what is the final output
    format
    
    ```{r pander, results='asis'}
    pander::pandoc.table(
      stats_by_year, 
      caption = "Year stats from the gapminder data"
      )
    ```


# Regression tables

*   There is a lot of functions around to include regression output

*   Suppose that we run the following models on the `diamonds` dataset
    
    ```{r multiple-regressions, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    data(diamonds, package="ggplot2")
    
    # Model 1
    model1 <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds)
    model2 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth, data = diamonds)
    model3 <- lm(price ~ carat + table, data = diamonds)
    model4 <- lm(price ~ carat + depth + table, data = diamonds)
    
    # Let's put it all in a list to handle it together
    models <- list(model1, model2, model3, model4)
    ```

*   How can we include these in our report/paper?


# Regression tables with texreg

*   The R package [**texreg**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=texreg){target="_blank"}
    
    ```{r texreg, results='asis'}
    texreg::htmlreg(models, doctype=FALSE)
    ```

*   It also has the functions `texreg`, for LaTeX tables, and `screenreg`, for plaintext output

*   The problem, you have to be explicit in the type of table that you want to print

# Regression tables with memisc

*   The R package [**pander**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pander){target="_blank"}

    ```{r memisc, results='asis'}
    library(memisc)
    tab <- mtable(
      `Model 1` = model1,
      `Model 2` = model2,
      `Model 3` = model3,
      `Model 4` = model4,
      summary.stats=c("sigma","R-squared","F","p","N")
    ) %>% write.mtable(file = stdout(), format = "HTML")
    ```

# Plots with Rmarkdown

*   In the case of plots, these just work!
    
    ```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price, color=cut)) + 
      geom_point() +
      ggtitle("Plots with Rmarkdown just work")
    
    ```


# Assignment

Using the dataset [**worldbank.csv**](worldbank.csv){target="_blank"}, write 
down an Rmarkdown document with the following:

1.  Include a table with the average value per `region` of the variables
    `hiv`, `cell`, and `gdp_ppp`.

2.  A plot with the average `hiv` prevalence worldwide by year.
    
3.  Include a regression table with the following linear model
    `hiv ~ log(gdp_ppp) + gini + factor(region)`.
 
Notice that the `mean` function will be handy, but be aware of missing values
(how does the `mean` function solves this?).

The document should be compiled as `html_document` (you can try other formats
if you like).
