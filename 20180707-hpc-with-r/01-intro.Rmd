# Before we start

We will be using:

-   R (of course), and you can get it from https://cloud.r-project.org/

-   RStudio (highly recommended), an IDE for R, and you can get if from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/

-   Materials for this presentation (including the presentation itself) can be downloaded from https://github.com/USCbiostats/intro2r-hcp-edition

# The R programming language

-   Free software oriented for **statistical computing** and **graphics** (although people use for everything now a days)

-   Is maintain mostly by the [**R Core Team**](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html){target="_blank"} (about 20 members worldwide), with the support of [**The R Foundation**](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/){target="_blank"}

-   Has a thriving community of users and developers worldwide:
      
      -   Institutional support from: [**rOpenSci**](https://rOpenSci.org){target="_blank"}, [**R Consortium**](https://www.r-consortium.org){target="_blank"}, etc.
          
      -   About **13,000 packages**(libraries) on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org){target="_blank"} (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)
      
      -   More than 1,000 attendees in useR!2017 conference

* R [@R] is an implementation of the S (Statistics) programming language, which was created in 1976 by **[John Chambers](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician))** while at Bell Labs. 

* R itself was created by **[Ross Ihaka](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka)** and **[Robert Gentleman](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician))** at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. First release in 1995.

* Currently developed by the **[R Development Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)**, of which Chambers is a member.

# The first lesson: Getting help 

## in R

In R, if you want to:

*   Know about the `sqrt` function? `?sqrt`, or `help("sqrt")`

*   Know about the `makeCluster` function in the R package `parallel`? `?parallel::makeCluster`, or `help("makeCluster", package="parallel")`

*   Know about the Regular Expressions? `??"Regular Expressions"`, or `help.search("Regular Expressions")`

*   See a full list of the functions and help files available in the package `boot`: `help(package="boot")`.

*   Look at more in deph information about the Matrix package? `vignette(package="Matrix")`

## On the web

*   Checkout the [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)

*   Take a look at the **rstats** tag on [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

*   Visit the [r-bloggers.com](https://r-bloggers.com) website

*   Read one of the dozens of online free books about R created with the [R package bookdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bookdown) at
    [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/)
    
*   Ask a question on twitter using the [\#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) hashtag.

# Questions

1.  Using the `stats` package, How can you estimate a **generalized linear model** in R?

2.  What is the command to **transpose** a matrix in R? What about the command for inverting a matrix?

3.  Looking at CRAN task Views, what R packages are available for convex optimization? What about stochastic optimization?

4.  Create a list of R packages that provide wrappers for working with Slurm.

5.  What does return the function for fitting nonlinear least squares in the `stats` package?
