This was my first time talking about HPC with R in my native language (spanish).

This very same workshop was taught during December 2018 and January 2019 at:

-   The SatRdays conference in Santiago de Chile (organized by my friends at the [R Users Group in SCL](https://www.meetup.com/useRchile/) and R [Ladies in SCL](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-scl/)).
-   Instituto Milenio para el Fundamento de los Datos at Universidad Católica de Chile ([website](https://imfd.cl)).
-   Núcleo Milenio para el estudio del curso de vida y vulnerabilidad at Universidad de Santiago de Chile (folks there were very nice and wrote two news articles based on my talk: [one](http://economia.usach.cl/index.php/noticias-blog/81-taller-computacion-de-alto-rendimiento-en-r)  and [two](http://mliv.cl/2019/01/23/mliv-capacita-a-estudiantes-de-postgrado-investigadores-y-academicos-en-r/)).
