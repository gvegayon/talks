As an invitation from Prof. Noshir Contractor, I gave this talk at Northwestern University's <a href="https://sonic.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">SONIC Lab</a> followed by a workshop on the tools that we have been developing for implemting the methods described in it. The lab was kind enough to record my talk as well as advertise it <a href="http://sonic.northwestern.edu/sonic-speaker-series-presents-george-g-vega-yon/" target="_blank">here</a>.

This is joint work with <a href=\"https://www.kayladelahaye.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Prof. Kayla de la Haye (USC)</a>.
